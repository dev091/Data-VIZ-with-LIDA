Overview

This Streamlit application leverages the LIDA (Language Interface for Data Analysis) library to provide comprehensive data visualization and analysis capabilities. It is designed to help users understand and interpret their data more effectively through automatic summarization, insightful questions, and corresponding visualizations.
Features

    Data Summarization:
        Upload a CSV file to receive an automated summary of the data.
        The app provides an overview of key statistics, data preview, and visual summaries such as heatmaps for missing values and correlation matrices.

    Top Questions and Answers:
        The app generates the top 5 most relevant questions based on the data summary.
        Each question is accompanied by a detailed answer, helping users gain deeper insights into their dataset.
        Corresponding charts are created for each question to visually represent the data, making the analysis more intuitive and accessible.

    Custom Query-Based Graph Generation:
        Users can input custom queries about their data to generate specific graphs.
        This feature allows for tailored analysis, enabling users to explore particular aspects of their dataset in detail.

How It Works

    Data Upload and Summarization:
        Users upload their CSV files through the Streamlit interface.
        The application reads the data and uses the LIDA library to generate a summary, which includes key statistics and visualizations.

    Automatic Question and Answer Generation:
        Based on the summary, the app formulates the top 5 questions relevant to the dataset.
        For each question, the app provides a detailed answer and generates a corresponding chart to visually represent the data.

    Custom Queries for Graphs:
        Users can type in specific questions or queries about their data.
        The app processes these queries to generate and display relevant charts, providing a flexible tool for data exploration.
